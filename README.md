# 3DGlobeAnimation

Apple allows you to create different shapes, gradients and masking effect using ***CALayer***. 
This project tries to utilise the some of the features of the CALayer to create the beautiful animated 3D Earth Globe.

Some of the features used in this project
* ```CAShapeLayer``` for creating Circular Shape
* ```CAGradientLayer``` for applying gradient effect to the shape layer
* ```CGAffineTransform``` for animating (translating) the UIView
